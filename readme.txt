Singularity-enriched physics-informed neural network(SEPINN)

These examples are for the article "Solving Possion problems in polygonal domains with singularity enriched physics neural network".

SEPINN for 2-d problem:

1. Data Prep

In this part we create the domain, either L-shaped or rectangle domain.

2. Test Data

The teat data is chosen in this part in X_v_test, and the true solution for the regular part is v_true and whole part is u_true. If you were to test the code with other functions, just change the function here.

3. Training Data
